		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>
			I've been working in non-profits for over a decade and in IT specifically for about 8 years.

		<h2>IT resources for non-profits</h2>
		<p>
			I've helped several non-profits of various sizes up their IT game. Often times non-profits have small IT teams with even smaller budgets. Sometimes the IT team is just the employee who is least tech-phobic. I am going to bring together the resources I've leveraged to build enterprise grade IT services without needing enterprise grade budget or staff. I'll also have some tips for choosing what to implement.
